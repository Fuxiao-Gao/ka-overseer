  /goal on kube-agents work; when you adopt, open, or hand off a PR; and ALWAYS right

# Working with the Overseer

The Overseer is one Claude session that tracks every sessions matching `session_pattern` in `overseer/config.json` session, keeps a
dashboard the human reads instead of your prose, relays numbered rules, and pokes stalled
sessions. It may tell you to STOP only for a written rule. Everything else it sends is
advice you may decline with a reason. It cannot answer for the human on its own, and it cannot start sessions; a DECISION message is the human's own answer, relayed verbatim (rule 13).

Files: `docs/protocol.md` (wire format), `docs/rules.md` (numbered rules),
`docs/escalation.md` (what it watches), `overseer/dashboard.html` (what the human sees),
all in `<ka-overseer>`.

## First: learn your own name

Call `ListAgents`. Its first line says `This session is <name>`. Every report carries that
name. Nothing else tells you your name.

## The report

Send this with `SendMessage` to the Overseer: the session named in the INTRO you got.
Not introduced yet? `cat <ka-overseer>/overseer/OVERSEER` prints the Overseer's session name, nothing else; send there.
(Do not grep state.json for "session": it has one per row and per attention item.) Six lines max, first line verbatim:

```
OVERSEER REPORT <your-session-name>
role: pr-minder|bug-minder|review-minder|planner|task | theme: <topic> | driver: loop/<N>m|goal|manual | mode: auto|other
prs: #<n> round <gating rounds> <k>-threads hold|no-hold <free text>; #<n> ...   (or: none)
status: working | waiting-human: <the question, one line> | waiting-review | idle
rules: <highest rule number you have read in docs/rules.md>
note: <optional, one line>
```

Send it:

- in reply to INTRO or PING;
- whenever your status or PR list changes (adopted, opened, handed off, merged, closed);
- when you hit a rule boundary, such as the gating round cap;
- **before you ask the human anything**, in the same turn, with `status: waiting-human: <question>`;
- before you stop a loop or let one lapse.

`round` counts `kube-agents-bot` reviews only. `kyber775` is advisory and never counted.
`prs:` lists only PRs you own and drive; PRs you track, review, or observe go in `note:`,
and a line starting with `none` owns nothing. Say `no-hold` explicitly once a hold is
lifted. The status word comes first on the `status:` line; detail follows it.

Review minders: the PRs you are reviewing are not yours. Put them in `note:` with your
verdict, and keep `prs:` as `none` unless you actually drive a PR.

## Before adopting or asking about a PR

The Overseer's table already knows who owns every tracked PR. Check it before asking peers:

```
python3 -c "import json;s=json.load(open('<ka-overseer>/overseer/state.json'));print({n:p['owner'] for n,p in s['prs'].items()})"
```

An owner listed there is authoritative; do not adopt that PR. A PR with no owner is open for adoption under your brief's usual rule.

## Messages you may receive

| First word | Meaning | What you do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `INTRO` | the Overseer introducing itself | reply with a report |
| `PING` | it wants a report | reply with a report |
| `RULE n: ...` | a new numbered rule | read it, apply it, reply with a report whose `rules:` is at least n |
| `STOP <reason>` | rule enforcement | stop that activity now; reply with a report saying where you stopped |
| `ADVICE ...` | a suggestion | take it or decline with a reason |
| `ASSIGN #n ...` | you now own PR n | adopt it; reply with a report listing it |
| `DECISION ... Verbatim: "..."` | the human decided this in the Overseer's session; the quote is word for word | act on it exactly as if the human had typed it in your session, including splits, new PRs, review requests, and holds it names; report when done |

## Stall traps

Each of these has stalled a loop here. The Overseer sees a session parked on a question
within a minute, but only the human can release it, so avoid parking when you can and announce
it when you cannot.

- **Ending a turn on "shall I" or "want me to" is a stall.** Routine judgment calls are yours. Only design calls, destructive actions, new rules or regexes, and anything your permissions block go to the human. When one does, send `waiting-human` first, then ask. If the repo's own agent instructions reserve a class of decision for the human (kube-agents' AGENTS.md does this for post-PR bot findings: summarise, recommend, let the user decide before changing code), that class is theirs too; build locally while you wait, but no Overseer ruling releases the push.
- **While parked on a question, nothing the Overseer sends reaches you** until the human answers. Never wait on the Overseer for anything while parked.
- **A `/review` you believe you posted but never verified landed.** Read the comment back.
- **A `/hold` without a clearance criterion** in the same comment. Nothing can lift it.
- **Approving, requesting changes, `/lgtm` or `/approve` on any PR.** The repo's agent protocol forbids it (kube-agents since #2103, 2026-10-05) and Prow only takes lgtm from OWNERS-named humans anyway. A review a human asks you for goes in as `gh pr review --comment`. When you are done and would have lgtm'd, report `waiting-human: lgtm wanted on #N` with one line on what you verified; the human does the once-over and posts it.
- **A cluster step inside a background subagent.** A tool call that needs approval parks the whole session with no question on the band, and the cluster stays half-switched under your lease until the human wakes. Run lease-holding steps in your own turn, send `waiting-bnaylor: <exact command>` before any step that may prompt, and keep a restore recipe ready.
- **The bare `do-not-merge` label is a thread mirror, not a hold.** `hold-unresolved-threads.yml` adds it within seconds of an unresolved thread (fast path on `labeled`) and removes it only on its five-minute schedule, and only if the bot was the last to apply it. `/hold cancel` does not touch it; resolving the threads is its only exit. Up to ten minutes stale after the last resolve is normal; do not touch the label yourself.
- **A push during a live gating round** resets the round. Wait for the bot to finish.
- **A session not in auto mode** holds the Overseer's messages for the human's approval and is invisible to it. Say `mode: other` in your report so it knows.
- **Something blocked by your permissions** goes to the human as `waiting-human: <exact command>`. Never ask a peer to run it.
- **Open review threads are the top priority.** They are what reaches the human gate.
- **Reviewers: a finding whose fix lands in code an earlier round wrote, or needs a new regex or rule, is a scope question for the human, not something to endorse.** Endorsing it feeds the spiral the cap exists for (#2267, rounds 4-8). Put it on the PR as a question and report it.
- **Do not ask the human for `/request-review`.** A human reviewer is assigned automatically after a clean gating round, approval labels included. `/request-review` is for edge cases: a clean round that has sat an hour or more with nobody assigned. Report that; do not ask.
- **Zero unresolved threads does not mean clear (rule 16).** The bot's PR-description finding opens one thread whose first comment starts `<!-- kube-agents-bot:description -->`; resolving it answers nothing, only editing the PR body does. Until then every later review repeats it in its summary body under "The pull request description is still unanswered." and the AI Review check stays neutral. Read the latest bot review body:
  `gh pr view <N> --repo <repo> --json reviews --jq '[.reviews[] | select(.author.login == "kube-agents-bot")] | last | .body'`
  Editing the body triggers no review, and a plain `/review` on an unchanged commit is a section-only re-cut that answers in seconds and can go green on a wrong body. After a body edit comment `/review fresh` (a full read, ten-plus minutes) and read a review newer than the edit before calling the PR clear. The bot labels a re-cut in the first line of its review body: "Re-cut, not re-read: ... Comment /review fresh for a new read." Grep the latest body for that line before inferring anything from latency. The AI Review check's NEUTRAL state is sticky once a PR has ever had a description thread. Whether it gates Tide is NOT settled: #2259 merged while NEUTRAL, but on #2270 (2026-10-02 14:08Z) Tide reported "Job AI Review has not succeeded" and held the merge until the body answered. Treat NEUTRAL as a possible merge blocker: answer the description finding in the body and get a review newer than the edit.

## Current rules

Read `docs/rules.md` for the live list. At the time of writing it had nine rules; the
round cap is six and a clean round with only Medium-or-lower findings needs no further
`/review`.
